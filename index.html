        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I study the fundamental building blocks of matter with the
          CMS experiment. On this site you can find out more about me and my research.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I am a graduate student at the University of California, Davis working with
              <a href="http://physics.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/robin-erbacher">Robin Erbacher</a>. 
              My research is on the Compact Muon Solenoid (<a href="https://cms.cern">CMS</a>) 
              experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operated by the European Organization 
              for Nuclear Research (<a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a>). I study the 
              substructure of collimated hadronic showers (jets) in order to reconstruct signatures 
              of new physics beyond the Standard Model. These signatures may be the result of 
              extra dimensions, Higgs compositeness, or Supersymmetry. In 2019 the LHC will 
              turn off for two years, during this time I will participating in upgrades of the 
              CMS endcap muon spectrometer.</p> 

              <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Florida, I worked with 
              <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/faculty/acosta.shtml">Darin Acosta</a> on the CMS experiment. 
              During this time, I contributed to the search for the Higgs boson decaying to two muons 
              and participated in upgrades to the Endcap Muon Trackfinder. For my undergraduate thesis, 
              I conducted a preliminary search for anomalous production of highly boosted Z bosons in 
              a dimuon final state.</p>

              <p> On the right, I am pictured in front of the older SLD Detecotor at the Stanford Linear
              Accelerator Center (SLAC). Above is an iSpy event display of the CMS expeirement at CERN</p>
