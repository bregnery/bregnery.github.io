My main interests are in experimental high energy physics. In the past, I did some work
exploring the connections between physics and ecology. During my undergraduate, I spent 
some time working with [Trevor Caughlin](http://www.trevorcaughlin.com/) and participated 
in UF in Kenya with [Todd Palmer](http://www.thepalmerlab.com/TMP/welcome.html).
On this website, I have documented these experiences.
