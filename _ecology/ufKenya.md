[UF in Kenya](http://www.thepalmerlab.com/TMP/field_school.html) is a three week long ecology field school and 
research program run by [Todd Palmer](http://www.thepalmerlab.com/TMP/welcome.html) in Laikipia, Kenya. I 
participated in this program in 2013 and I continue to draw upon the experience. During these three weeks we
observed African wildlife, learned about current problems in conservation, and studied the mutulastic
relationship between ants and Acacia drepanolobium.

## Ant-Plant Mutualism

0n the savannas in Lakapia, Kenya four species of ants have a mutualistic relationship with Acacia drepanolobium.
A. drepanolobium have specialized thorns that grow into hollow bulbs, ants can drill into these bulbs and make 
a home in these trees. In return, the ants attack animals that attempt to eat A. drepanolobium. If an elephant 
attepmts to eat A. drepanolobium, then a swarm of ants will charge into the elephants trunk. The trees provide 
a home for the ants and the ants provide protection for the trees.

There are still many questions about this mutualism. Such as, how is it being affected by climate change and how does 
the mutualism vary for each species? During the UF in Kenya program, we studied ecology field research techniques by 
attempting to answer similar questions with our own research on this ant-plat mutualism. 

## My Experience

Like many young college students, I was uncertain of what I wanted to major in. For me, I was torn between studying 
physics or ecology. This study abroad experience presented a chance for me to complete one of my life dreams of
visiting the beautiful savannas in Kenya and the opportunity for me to gain incredible experience that would answer 
the question "Should I pursue a career in ecology?" During this program, I did much more than answer that question.

Before this program, I did not appreciate the complexity of conservation. Part of each day in Kenya was spent studying 
conservation with [Wayne Sentman](https://waynesentman.zenfolio.com/about.html). Wayne taught us about the global
political issues surrounding conservation. Often, he would present us with a present-day issue and challange us to
propose possible solutions.
