title: Research with Animal Movement Patterns
permalink: /ecology/movement/

At the University of Florida, I worked with [Trevor Caughlin](http://www.trevorcaughlin.com/) to study the effects of animal
movement patterns on seed dispersal. Specifically, we created a computer simulation that used mathematical models to describe
the movement of different types of animal seed dispersers and studied the effect that these different models had on dispersal
of seeds from a simulated fruit bearing tree. Once completed we presented our results with a poster at the 2014 ESA Conference. 

## ESA Abstract
