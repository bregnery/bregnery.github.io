            <h1>UF in Kenya</h1>
            <div id="markdown-content-container"><p><a href="http://www.thepalmerlab.com/TMP/field_school.html">UF in Kenya</a> is a three week long ecology field school and 
research program run by <a href="http://www.thepalmerlab.com/TMP/welcome.html">Todd Palmer</a> in Laikipia, Kenya. I 
participated in this program in 2013 and I continue to draw upon the experience. During these three weeks we
observed African wildlife, learned about current problems in conservation, and studied the mutualistic
relationship between ants and Acacia drepanolobium.</p>

<h2 id="ant-plant-mutualism">Ant-Plant Mutualism</h2>

<p>0n the savannas in Laikipia, Kenya four species of ants have a mutualistic relationship with Acacia drepanolobium.
A. drepanolobium have specialized thorns that grow into hollow bulbs, ants can drill into these bulbs and make 
a home in these trees. In return, the ants attack animals that attempt to eat A. drepanolobium. If an elephant 
attepmts to eat A. drepanolobium, then a swarm of ants will charge into the elephants trunk. The trees provide 
a home for the ants and the ants provide protection for the trees.</p>

<p>There are still many questions about this mutualism. Such as, how is it being affected by climate change and how does 
the mutualism vary for different ant species? During the UF in Kenya program, we studied ecology field research techniques by 
attempting to answer similar questions with our own research on this ant-plat mutualism.</p>

<h2 id="additional-field-research-techniques">Additional Field Research Techniques</h2>

<p>Ecology is a wide field with numerous important techniques for studying animals. In order to observe research
techniques that are not used to study ants, Todd introduced us to various local researchers. One group taught us 
various techniques for studying birds. 
They set traps on the ground for catching birds and used mist nets to catch birds in flight. Then, they taught us how 
to tag the birds with bands around their ankles. Another group introduced us to GPS collars. They gave us several 
lectures and explained the basics behind doing research with these collars.</p>

<h2 id="conservation">Conservation</h2>

<p>Before this program, I did not appreciate the complexity of conservation. Part of each day in Kenya was spent studying 
conservation with <a href="https://waynesentman.zenfolio.com/about.html">Wayne Sentman</a>. Wayne taught us about the global
political issues surrounding conservation. Often, he would present us with a present-day issue and challenge us to
propose possible solutions. For example: “How can we reduce plastic in the world’s oceans?”, “What role should trophy hunting 
play in conservation?”, “How can we reduce the demand for poached animals?”</p>

<p>Wayne showed us some groups that we tackling these issues. One of the most memorable being 
<a href="http://oceansole.co.ke/">OceanSole</a> a group in Kenya that turns flip flops that wash up on beaches into sculptures.
This encourages locals to clean the beaches and helps give money to local artists. These sculptures are available 
for purchase in the US at <a href="https://oceansole.us/">OceanSoleUS</a>.</p>

<p>Education goes hand in hand with conservation. When a society is more educated, they understand the benefits of 
conserving endangered species and important habitats. Wayne introduced us to some groups that were attempting 
to increase access to education for women by simply increasing the accessibility of feminine hygiene products.</p>

<h2 id="excursions">Excursions</h2>

<p>During this trip, we participated in many excursions where we observed African wildlife and got to experience 
Kenyan culture. These included visiting Nairobi and Nanyuki, traveling to a Masai villages, and observing African
wildlife. We made many friends along the way and had many unforgettable moments.</p>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>Ultimately, I decided that a career in ecology was not right for me. But I do not want that fact to down play the 
impact that this program had on me. This program changed the way that I view the world and the way that approach
research in physics. I am incredibly grateful to Todd, Wayne, and the University of Florida for this phenomenal 
program. I truly believe that every university student should participate in a study abroad experience.</p>
