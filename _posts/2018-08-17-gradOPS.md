The physics graduate students at the University of California, Davis recently created a new graduate council.
I am excited to serve as the 2018-2019 colloquium committee representative for this new organization.

Find out more about the Graduate Organization of Physics Students (GradOPS) on the [gradOPS website][gradOPS].
