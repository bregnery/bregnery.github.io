I am excited that this website is finally up and running! 

This Website was build using [Jekyll][jekyll] with the 
[Jekyll Doc Theme][jekyll-doc]. I highly recommed the Jekyll Doc Theme; It is well coded and uses some nice javascript
to go the extra step in making a gorgeous design.

For the logo, I used [logomkr][logomkr], which is a free logo making website.

Please enjoy my website! And feel free to use the links on this post to make your own!
