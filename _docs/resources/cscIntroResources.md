## What is a Cathode Strip Chamber?

A Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) is a precision gas chamber 
that can operate with high rates and in irregular magnetic fields. Inside of a CSC are radial cathode strips
and orthogonal anode wires. As muons pass through these chambers, they create a trail of ions. The electrons 
in this trail move toward anode wires and the positively charged ions move towrd the cathode strips. Using this
information, the paths of muons through the endcaps of the CMS detector can be reconstructed. Below are some 
great introcutory resources for CSCs:

  provides a quick overview of CSCs
* [CSC 101](https://indico.cern.ch/event/522500/) is a very detailed overview of the CSCs with many slide shows

## Resources for CSC Electronics

The specialized electronics in the CSCs have many acronyms and this gets very jargon heavy. Manuel Franco Sevilla wrote
a great 
[overview of CSC electronics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/741985/contributions/3063857/attachments/1687237/2713595/18-07-16_manuelf_csc_electronics.pdf),
which defines many of these acronyms.
The full indico event should eventually include a recording. This event is linked below:
