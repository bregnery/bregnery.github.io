## About my website

First off, welcome to my website! I have information about me on the [homepage](https://bregnery.github.io) and career information on my [CV]().
This website contains a hodgepodge of information including: useful links for CMS analysts, tutorials for using various 
particle physics tools, infomation about fun programming tools, and posts about my current research.

## The CMS Experiment

The Compact Muon Solenoid ([CMS](https://cms.cern)) experiment is particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN](https://home.cern)). CMS studies the fundamental building blocks of
matter by observing proton-proton collisions at the 27 km LHC. In 2017, the CMS experiment observed collisions every 
25 ns at center of mass energies of 13 TeV. In other words, CMS deals with high data rates, large amounts of data,
and large backgrounds. CMS analysts need to utilize a range of skills to handle these problems--including: building
custom electronics, working with machine learning algorithms, and using statistical software.
