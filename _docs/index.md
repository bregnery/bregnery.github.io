## About my website

First off, welcome to my website! I have information about me on the [homepage](https://bregnery.github.io) and career information on my [CV]().
This website contains a hodgepodge of information including: useful links for CMS analysts, tutorials for using various 
particle physics tools, infomation about fun programming tools, and posts about my current research.

This page provides a brief introduction to my research. For more advanced information, tutorials, and resources please explore any of the 
links on my website.

## The CMS Experiment

The Compact Muon Solenoid ([CMS](https://cms.cern)) experiment is particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN](https://home.cern)). CMS studies the fundamental building blocks of
matter by observing proton-proton collisions at the 27 km LHC. In 2017, the CMS experiment observed collisions every 
25 ns at center of mass energies of 13 TeV. In other words, CMS deals with high data rates, large amounts of data,
and large backgrounds. CMS analysts need to utilize a range of skills to handle these problems---including: building
custom electronics, working with machine learning algorithms, and using specialized software.

## Beyond Two Generations (B2G)

[B2G](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook) is a CMS physics analysis group (PAG). B2G searches for 
resonances decaying to heavy Standard Model particles; these resonances could be the result of extra dimensions, a fourth 
generation of matter, or Supersymmetry. These resonances often have hadronic final states that contain collimated streams
of particles (jets) with unique substructure.

I am involved with training neural networks to identify these jet substructures. In particular, I am interested 
in diHiggs resonances and vector-like quarks with all hadronic final states.

## Muon Endcap Spectrometer

The Muon Endcap Spectrometer tracks muons as they pass through the forward regions of the CMS detector. This spectromenter 
consists of three different types of gaseous chambers: Resistive Plate Chambers ([RPCs](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/resistive-plate-chambers)),
Cathode Strip Chambers ([CSCs](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cathode-strip-chambers)), and 
Gas Electron Multipliers ([GEMs](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/MPGD/GEMDetectorProduction)). In 2019, the LHC 
will be shutdown for upgrades. During this time, the CSCs will be refurbished and upgraded and additional GEM chambers will
be installed. I will be participating in these upgrades.

## Previous Work

### Higgs to Dimuons

HiggsToMuMu is a working group in the Higgs PAG. HiggsToMuMu is searching for predicted Standard Model process of Higgs decaying to 
two muons. I assisted in the Run 2 search, our results are summarized in this 
[CMS analysis note](http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/db_notes/noteInfo.jsp?cmsnoteid=CMS%20AN-2017/098).

### Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF)

The EMTF is a portion of the Level 1 Trigger for CMS. The trackfinder sorts through electronic signals recieved by the the Endcap 
Muon Spectrometer to reconstruct the paths of muons as they travel through the detector. The EMTF accomplishes this by using 
a set of custom electronics. I assisted with the upgrade from the CSCTF to the EMTF at the end of Long Shutdown 1.

### Search for Anamolous Production of Boosted Z Bosons

For my undergraduate thesis at the University of Florida, I conducted a preliminary search for anomolous production of boosted Z
bosons decaying to two muons. If discovered, these Z bosons would be the result of new physics. Currently,
this thesis is not publicly available. I will update this website with links once it becomes publicly accessible.
