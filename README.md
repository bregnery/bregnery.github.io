# Personal Website

This website was made with the [Jekyll Doc Theme](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/).

The local run instructions are directly from aksalli's original readme:

## Running locally

You need Ruby and gem before starting, then:

```bash
# install bundler
gem install bundler

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme.git
cd jekyll-doc-theme

# run jekyll with dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
To run this specific website locally, just replace the template repository with this repository.
